## Description
  * Create these directories to organize your code:
    * app
    * app/config
    * app/view
    * app/view/home
    * app/view/landing
    * app/scss
    * app/scss/lib

  * This should include a button that will trigger a **DELETE** request to the `slugram-backend` API and remove the current gallery information from the view
  * Create an `edit-gallery` component that is nested in the component used to display gallery information
  * A **submit event** should trigger a **PUT** request to the `slugram-backend` API which will update the gallery info and then update the view to reflect the changes

## POST `/api/gallery`

  * headers required
    * `Authorization` :  `Bearer <token>`
